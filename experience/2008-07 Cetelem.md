** Print flow management at [Cetelem](http://www.cetelem.fr/) (as Contractor)**

Cetelem is a reference in personal loan. It's part of [BNP Paribas Personal Finance](http://www.bnpparibas-pf.com/en/).
Management of application flows for mass printing (files > 10GB)
Team size ~20, only I worked on the software

- Flow evolutions (Groovy/bash/Sreamweaver), rewriting a substantial part of it
- Creation of a printing jobs monitoring system
- Refactoring the code base (libraries, unit testing, documentation)
- Grouping files to gain on the stamp price (Managing large volumes, significant savings)
- Daily maintenance (Production management, Debugging, Adding new flow) (ksh/StreamWeaver)
- Establishment of a routing system with Printnet PA (Java/Groovy)
-- Copy existing flow (large amount of disparate files)
-- Sending securely to printing server or external company providers
- Creation of programs :
-- ticket/request tool in Sharepoint (WSS)
-- Sharepoint data extraction program (Perl)
-- EBCDIC data extraction tool with GUI (Java AWT)
-- Image format conversion with GUI (Python / tk)
-- Unit testing launcher for Dialogue (VBScript)

Output : flows easier to use and monitor, far less production problems, been replaced by two software developers, got a contract between my company and Printnet
