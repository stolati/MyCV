Etienne Couritas
Developer at Thales, now at [Mister Bell](http://www.misterbell.com/)

Mickael and I met at Thales and he was my mentor during this period. 
He clearly enjoy teaching about programming and gave me loads of good advices. 
When he sees un-optimized practice he tried to optimize it.
The best example is the debugger he created in TCL because we couldn't have a proper one. 
I look forward to work with him again.
