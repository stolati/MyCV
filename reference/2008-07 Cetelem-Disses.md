Nathalie Disses
Publishing Manager at Cetelem

Mickael is a reliable developer.
During his stay at Cetelem he did more than his share of work,
like managing the production, and helping/teaching the dedicated team.
He also created tools for other teams in a variety of technologies. 
More than once, he saved the day by quick response and programming skills.
He rewrote all of the core code, so well in fact that it hasn't needed much modification since his departure. 
In his day-to-day work, Mickael was autonomous.
He sorted the subjects himself and handled easely new priority jobs.
