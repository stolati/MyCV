Denis-Gilles Laurent
IT Project Manager at Apec

I work with MickaÃ«l during 6 months as project Manager.
He was in charge of converting ezpublish content to jahia.
Without nowing anything ang using the technology of his choice he perefctly succeeded in one single month.
I consider Mickael as curious and talented developper.
I think that his true interest in technology allow him to adapt to many challenges.
